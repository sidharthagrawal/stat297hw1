##4.0 R Markdown Syntax

###4.1 Cache Example

Example of cache leading to misleading answers: 

cache=TRUE for all of these

```{r, cache=TRUE,results='hide'}
(x = 8)
```
```{r, cache=TRUE,results='hide'}
(y = 2 * x)
```
The current values for $x$ = `r x` and $y$ = `r y`

```{r recalc, cache=TRUE,results='hide'}
(x = 4)
```
The current values for $x$ = `r x` and $y$ = `r y`

###4.2 Random Sample Example

```{r}
x = rnorm(100)
(mean = mean (x))
(median = median(x))
(variance = var(x))
if(mean == 0){
  print("The mean is equal to the theoretical value")
} else{
  print("The mean is not equal to the theoretical value")
}
if(median == 0){
  print("The median is equal to the theoretical value")
} else{
  print("The median is not equal to the theoretical value")
}
if(variance == 1){
  print("The variance is equal to the theoretical value")
} else{
  print("The variance is not equal to the theoretical value")
}
```

###4.3 Histogram Example
```{r, fig.cap=paste("The histgram of x")}
hist(x)
```

###4.4 Latex Equation Example
$$\begin{aligned}
     \mathbb{E} \left[ \text{var} \left\{
                     \boldsymbol{v}_1\left(
                       \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}},n\right) \big|
                     \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \right\}  \right] 
&=
                 \text{var} \left\{ \mathbf{v}_1\left(
                     \boldsymbol{\theta}_0,n\right)  \right\}  +
                 \mathbb{E} \left[\mathcal{O}_p\left\{
{\bf D}_1(\boldsymbol{\theta}^*,n)(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} - \boldsymbol{\theta}_{0}), 
\dots,
{\bf D}_p(\boldsymbol{\theta}^*,n)(\boldsymbol{\theta} - \boldsymbol{\theta}_{0})
\right\}\right]\\
    &= \text{var} \left\{ \mathbf{v}_1\left( \boldsymbol{\theta}_0,n\right)  \right\}  + \mathcal{O}\left(n^{-2}\right).
\end{aligned}$$


###4.5 In-line Equation
In-line Equation:$\mathbf{A} \equiv \left[a_{i,j}\right]_{i,j = 1, \ldots, p}$

###4.6 Blue Text Example

<span style="color:blue">“Vérité dans un temps, erreur dans un autre.”, Charles de Montesquieu</span>.

###4.7 Button Example

actionButton(inputId, label, icon = NULL, width = NULL, ...)

###4.8 Colored Box Example
```
.foo {
  float: left;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  margin: 5px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, .2);
}

.blue {
  background: #13b4ff;
}

.purple {
  background: #ab3fdd;
